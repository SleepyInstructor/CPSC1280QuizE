Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. 
It has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers and orbits the Sun every 88 days. 
Mercury has extreme temperature variations, ranging from -173째C at night to 427째C 
during the day. It has no atmosphere to retain heat, resulting in these drastic 
changes.

Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size to Earth, with a 
diameter of about 12,104 kilometers. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly 
of carbon dioxide, which creates a strong greenhouse effect, making it the hottest 
planet in the Solar System with surface temperatures around 465째C. Venus has a 
slow rotation, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation.

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. 
It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and orbits the Sun every 365.25 days. 
Earth has a diverse climate and a protective atmosphere composed of nitrogen, oxygen, 
and other gases. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and 
stabilizes the planet's axial tilt.

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known as the Red Planet due to its 
reddish appearance caused by iron oxide on its surface. It has a diameter of about 
6,779 kilometers and orbits the Sun every 687 days. Mars has a thin atmosphere 
composed mainly of carbon dioxide and experiences cold temperatures, averaging around 
-60째C. It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System, 
with a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers. It has a strong magnetic field and 
is known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for centuries. 
Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four largest: Io, Europa, Ganymede, 
and Callisto. It takes about 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun.

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is famous for its stunning ring 
system, composed of ice and rock particles. It has a diameter of about 116,460 
kilometers and orbits the Sun every 29.5 years. Saturn has a low density and is 
mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. It has at least 83 moons, with Titan 
being the largest and having a thick atmosphere.

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and has a unique tilt, rotating on its
side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. It has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers
and orbits the Sun every 84 years. Uranus has a cold atmosphere composed mainly of 
hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a blue-green color. It has 27 known moons 
and a faint ring system.

Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, with a diameter of about
49,244 kilometers. It has a strong wind system, with the fastest winds in the 
Solar System reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. Neptune has a 
deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere and orbits the Sun every 
165 years. It has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest.
